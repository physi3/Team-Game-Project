# Team Game Project
[Conquer Galaxy](https://conquer-galaxy.herokuapp.com "This is a link to the website.") is a web application built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/ "Express") in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ "nodejs") hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com "Heroku"). It uses [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/ "node-postgres") to interact with the database - which is on Heroku.
## Idea
* Some kind of game where progress is stored
* Strategic kind of empire game - like clash of clans
* Sci-fi twist 

* Create an account on the website
* Link the account to a discord account via a DMed key using a bot
## How would it work
* The game (in p5 probably) would be hosted on the website
* A database with tables for authentication and game-related info
