## Idea
* Some kind of game where progress is stored
* Strategic kind of empire game - like clash of clans
* Sci-fi twist 

* Create an account on the website
* Link the account to a discord account via a DMed key using a bot
## How would it work
* The game (in p5 probably) would be hosted on the website
* A database with tables for authentication and game-related info
